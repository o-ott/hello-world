   1) energy-demand-wrt-temp
   
      data-driven thesis project

fun fact:

    some species of jellyfish, despite not possessing brains, still need sleep*. 
    this means that sleeping is a function of being alive, not of thinking. 
    also, when their sleep gets interupted, they get tired and take naps.
